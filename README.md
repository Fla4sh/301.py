# Description:

A .py script that checks redirects and valid URLs from a list of URLs in a text file. The script uses the requests library to send HTTP requests and handle responses.

If the URL redirects to another page, the script follows up to 3 redirections and determines the final URL. If the URL redirects to a 404 page, the script considers it a bad URL. Otherwise, the script saves the valid URL to a new text file and prints the final URL.

# Usage:

Save your list of URLs to a text file, with one URL per line.
Run the script in a Python environment.
Enter the file path of your text file when prompted.
The script will output the redirection status of each URL and save the valid URLs to a new text file.
